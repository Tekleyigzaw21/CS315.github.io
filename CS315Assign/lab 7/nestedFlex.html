          The order property is designed to lay the items out in ordinal groups.
          What this means is that items are assigned an integer that represents
          their group. The items are then placed in the visual order according
          to that integer, lowest values first. If more than one item has the
          same integer value, then within that group the items are laid out as
          per source order

          to a positive integer, flex items can grow along the main axis from
          their flex-basis.

          The order property is designed to lay the items out in ordinal groups.
          What this means is that items are assigned an integer that represents
          their group.This will cause the item to stretch and take up any
          available space on that axis, or a proportion of the available space
          if other items are allowed to grow too.
