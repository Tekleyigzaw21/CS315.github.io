          Ethiopia is a landlocked country in the Horn of Africa and one of the
          largest and most populated countries in the world. The Ethiopian diet
          is very healthy and full off nutritious minerals. There are some key
          ingredients and foods that are key features in Ethiopian cuisine.
          Injera is a very popular accompaniment for most meals where people can
          scoop up their food. Injera is made with teff, a tiny, round grain
          that flourishes in the highlands of Ethiopia. Teff is very nutritious
          and contains practically no gluten. Torn off pieces of injera are used
          to scoop up thick vegetable or meat stews.
